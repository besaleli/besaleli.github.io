# About Me

<img src="assets/headshot.png", width=200 align="right">

I am an independent technology consultant specialized in NLP/GenAI systems architecture for MSP & enterprise solutions clients. Previously, I was Head of AI at Seek AI, researching semantic parsing & information retrieval systems for enterprise Text-to-SQL products. 

In 2023, I earned my MS in Computational Linguistics at Montclair State University, where I worked on research in lexical semantic change detection at the Montclair NLP Lab. In 2021, I graduated from the Great Books Program at St. John's College with a BA in Liberal Arts.

In my free time, I'm an active OSS contributor and am core maintainer, along with some close friends, of an open-source ML observability platform, [Ptolemy](https://github.com/PtolemyLovesYou/ptolemy). Outside of NLP, I enjoy cooking, travel, and people with caustic senses of humor. I am obnoxiously proud of being verified at Bassiani, and my favorite subway line is the Q. I adore reading and my favorite authors are Evelyn Waugh, Mikhail Bulgakov, and Giuseppe di Lampedusa.

I am accepting new engagements and would love to hear more about your AI/ML needs! Feel free to contact me at raz [at] besaleli [dot] io if you have any potential collaborations or would just like to chat!
